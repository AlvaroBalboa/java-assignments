# Arrays and Classes

## Description

We spent time going over examples of when to use an array, a class, or a combination of both. For this assignment, come up with five of your own examples. It should be in the same format as in class: a short description followed by the code that represents it. You can use the JREPL to test your code. Try to have at least one of them be a nested data structure (a class that contains an array, for example).
