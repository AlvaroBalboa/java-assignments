### Arrays and Classes

We spent time going over examples of when to use an array, a class, or a combination of both. For this assignment, come up with five of your own examples. It should be in the same format as in class: a short description followed by the code that represents it. You can use the JREPL to test your code. Try to have at least one of them be a nested data structure (a class that contains an array, for example).

Example:

```java
// A list of tweets.

class Tweet {
  String text;
  String username;
}

Tweet[] tweets;
```

To submit, simply create an issue in this repository and include your work in the text area that it provides. You can name the issue "1.1".
