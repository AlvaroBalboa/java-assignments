## Week 1 - Data first, code second

### Day 1

* Overview of the class
* History of Java
  * Low level vs high level
  * Context of Java's birth in the 90's
  * How it works (bytecode, VM, etc)
* Setup
  * Install JDK 8
    * [OSX and Windows](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
    * Linux
      * `sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk`
  * Install [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
  * Install the JREPL IntelliJ plugin
    * Preferences -> Browse repositories… -> Search for “JREPL”
* Intro to Java
  * Start the REPL
    * Tools -> Start JREPL
  * Scalar variables
    * int
    * char
    * String
  * Data structures
    * Sequential vs key-value
    * Create arrays and classes

### Day 2

* Data structures
  * Review arrays and classes
  * Static vs dynamic
  * Create ArrayLists and HashMaps
  * Contrast the four data structures
    * Array (static sequential)
    * Class (static key-value)
    * ArrayList (dynamic sequential)
    * HashMap (dynamic key-value)
* Classes
  * A class is more than just a data structure; it can contain code
  * All code must exist inside a class
  * Create blank project in IntelliJ
    * Create a class
      * Define a few fields
      * Define a method
      * Run it in the REPL
      * Public vs private
      * ArrayList and HashMap are classes

### Day 3

* Methods in Detail
  * Constructor methods
  * Static methods
  * System class (including System.out.println)
  * Create a static method in our project and run it in the REPL
  * Go over examples and decide whether a method should be static or not
* More about Strings
  * StringBuilder
  * Formatter
  * System.out.printf

### Day 4

* Control flow
  * Conditionals
  * Loops
  * Recursion
  * Exceptions
