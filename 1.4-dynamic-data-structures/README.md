# Dynamic Data Structures

## Description

Extend your ATM code to allow adding and removing new bank accounts. Obviously, this is not typically a feature of ATMs, but we are innovators.

## Requirements

* Store all user accounts in a dynamic data structure (`ArrayList` or `HashMap`).
* When the user types a name that isn't recognize, offer to create an account for them.
* After creating the account, loop back to the first step and ask for their name.
