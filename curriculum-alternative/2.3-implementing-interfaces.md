## Interfaces

In the `HelloWorld` project, create an `ArrayList` of names:

* `ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();`
* `names.add("Alice");`
* `names.add("Charlie");`
* `names.add("Bob");`

Now, sort it alphabetically:

* `Collections.sort(names);`

Now create an `ArrayList` of `Person` objects (create the necessary `Person` constructor first):

* `ArrayList<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();`
* `people.add(new Person("Alice"));`
* `people.add(new Person("Charlie"));`
* `people.add(new Person("Bob"));`

Now try to sort it:

* `Collections.sort(people);`
* `ERROR: no suitable method found for sort(java.util.ArrayList<Person>)`

The issue is that Java doesn't know how to sort a `Person` object, since it's a class we designed ourselves. We need a way to tell it how it should sort them. We can do that by implementing an interface called `Comparable` in the `Person` class and writing the necessary `compareTo` method:

```java
public class Person {
    ...
    
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Object o) {
        Person p = (Person) o;
        return name.compareTo(p.name);
    }
}
```

Now you can recreate that `ArrayList<Person>` and the sort method should now work.
