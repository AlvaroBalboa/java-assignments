## Review

Last week, we covered inheritance (extending classes and implementing interfaces).

## IronBattle

Create a new project called `IronBattle`. This will be a simple game that lets you create a player and an ogre, and then they will fight until one of them dies.

Let's begin with a general class that represents the things that the player and the enemy have in common. We'll call it `Character`:

```java
public class Character {
    String name;
    int health;
    int damage;
    
    public Character() {
    	
    }
    
    public Character(String name, int health, int damage) {
		super();
		this.name = name;
		this.health = health;
		this.damage = damage;
	}
}
```

Let's say we want our player to also store what weapon and armor they are holding. We don't want to add these fields to `Character`, because they aren't particularly useful for ogres, who (in our imaginary world) are naked and fight with their fists.

We can solve this by creating subclasses for the player and the ogres. Let's create a `Player` class:

```java
public class Player extends Character {
    String weapon;
    String armor;
    
	public Player(String name, int health, int damage, String weapon, String armor) {
		super(name, health, damage);
		this.weapon = weapon;
		this.armor = armor;
	}
}
```

Since it extends `Character`, it will inherit whatever fields or methods are in that class. Now let's make an `Ogre` class which stores the ogre's strength:

```java
public class Ogre extends Character {
	int strength;

	public Ogre(String name, int health, int damage, int strength) {
		super(name, health, damage);
		this.strength = strength;
	}
}
```

Create a new class in the project called `Main` and give it a main method. Let's just create our objects for now:

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Player p = new Player("Bilbo", 100, 20, "sword", "leather");
		Ogre o = new Ogre("Strife-and-hatred", 100, 20, 5);
		System.out.println(p.name + " vs. " + o.name);
	}
}
```

Let's change our classes so the player and ogre update their health and damage based on the extra parameters they were given:

```java
public class Player extends Character {
    String weapon;
    String armor;
    
	public Player(String name, int health, int damage, String weapon, String armor) {
		super(name, updateHealth(health, armor), updateDamage(damage, weapon));
		this.weapon = weapon;
		this.armor = armor;
	}
	
	static int updateHealth(int health, String armor) {
		if (armor.equals("leather")) {
			return health + 10;
		}
		else if (armor.equals("chainmail")) {
			return health + 20;
		}
		return health;
	}
	
	static int updateDamage(int damage, String weapon) {
		if (weapon.equals("sword")) {
			damage += 10;
		}
		else if (weapon.equals("mace")) {
			damage += 20;
		}
		return damage;
	}
}
```

```java
public class Ogre extends Character {
	int strength;

	public Ogre(String name, int health, int damage, int strength) {
		super(name, health, damage + (2 * strength));
		this.strength = strength;
	}
}
```

Now we're ready to create the battle system. Let's write a `battle` method in the `Character` class, so both players and ogres can engage in battle:

```java
public class Character {
    ...
	
	public void battle(Character enemy) {
        System.out.printf("%s appears!\n", enemy.name);

        while (health > 0 && enemy.health > 0) {
            health -= enemy.damage;
            enemy.health -= damage;
            System.out.printf("%s's health: %d\n", name, health);
            System.out.printf("%s's health: %d\n", enemy.name, enemy.health);
        }

        String message = "%s has died.\n";

        if (health <= 0) {
            System.out.printf(message, name);
        }

        if (enemy.health <= 0) {
            System.out.printf(message, enemy.name);
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, run the battle method in the main class:

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Player p = new Player("Bilbo", 100, 20, "sword", "leather");
		Ogre o = new Ogre("Strife-and-hatred", 100, 20, 5);
		System.out.println(p.name + " vs. " + o.name);
		p.battle(o);
	}
}
```

With the current numbers, both characters end up dying! Try messing with the inputs to change the result.
