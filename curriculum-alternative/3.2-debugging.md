## Debugging

Up until now, you've primarily been using `System.out.println` to figure out what a particular variable contains at a given time. This is fine for small projects, but can be a very crude form of debugging as time goes on. Typical Java IDEs like Eclipse provide a much more powerful way of doing this.

The way it works is, you set one or more "breakpoints" somewhere in your code. Then you run your program in a special debug mode, which causes it to freeze when it hits one of the breakpoints. Then, the IDE will display a list of all the variables defined up to that point and what values they contain.

Let's open up the `HelloWorld` project to try it out. Find a line somewhere near the end of the main method and double click the gutter on the left side of the editor. You should see a small dot appear there. The, right-click anywhere in the file and choose `Debug As -> Java Application`.

This will bring up a few new panes and run your program. When it hits the breakpoint, it will pause and you will see a list of variables. For complex objects, you can even drill inside them to see what their fields are set to! When you're done, you can stop the program with the red square button and close the debugging panes.
