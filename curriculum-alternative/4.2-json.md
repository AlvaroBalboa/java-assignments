## JSON

When we want to store structured data, we need a more complicated format to serialize to and parse from. One common format is called JSON. Let's add a JSON library to the `HelloWorld` project.

First, right-click on the `HelloWorld` project and go to `Configure -> Convert to Maven Project` and then click `Finish`. You should see the `pom.xml` file open with Eclipse's visual editor. Near the bottom you'll see a `Dependencies` tab. Switch to it and click the `Add...` button, and for group id, artifact id, and version, enter `org.jodd`, `jodd-json`, and `3.6.7` respectively. Save the file after finishing.

Now, we can create `ReadWriteJson` to learn how to use it. Note that for the following to work, the `Person` class must have getters for all the fields you wish to serialize into JSON. The presence of a getter method is how the JSON library determines that to serialize and what to ignore.

```java
public class ReadWriteJson {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Person p = new Person();
        p.name = "Alice Smith";
        p.age = 30;
        
        File f = new File("person.json");

        // write json
        JsonSerializer serializer = new JsonSerializer();
        String json = serializer.serialize(p);
        FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(f);
        fw.write(json);
        fw.close();

        // read json
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        s.useDelimiter("\\Z");
        String contents = s.next();
        JsonParser parser = new JsonParser();
        Person p2 = parser.parse(contents, Person.class);

        System.out.println(p2);
    }
}
```
