## Testing

Testing is an important way of catching and preventing bugs. IDEs like Eclipse provide built-in support for writing and running them. First, let's write a simple little method for testing purposes. In your `HelloWorld` project, create a static method that checks if a string is a valid name:

```java
public static boolean isValidName(String name) {
    return name.split(" ").length == 2;
}
```

Now right-click on `Main.java` in the Project Explorer and go to `New -> Other...`. Then search for "JUnit", select `JUnit Test Case`, and click `Next` and then `Finish`. If it asks you to add the JUnit library, do so. You should now see `MainTest.java`. It should start with a small test method:

```java
@Test
public void test() {
    fail("Not yet implemented");
}
```

In this method, we want to call the method we wrote and assert whether the result is what we expected it to be. For example, the name "Hello" should be invalid, since there is no space, and "John Doe" should be valid. We can simply call the method with those arguments and check that they return the expected result:

```java
@Test
public void test() {
    assertTrue(Main.isValidName("Hello") == false);
    assertTrue(Main.isValidName("John Doe"));
}
```

Let's try to run this test. Right click anywhere in the file and go to `Run As -> JUnit Test`. This should bring up a pane showing the tests that were run and a green bar indicating it succeeded. Try changing `false` to `true` to verify that the test fails.
