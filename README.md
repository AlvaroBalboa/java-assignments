## General

* Use industry-standard tools
  * JDK 8
  * IntelliJ (easy to transition later to Clojure using the Cursive plugin)
* Focus on data structures
  * Emphasize the distinction between code and data
  * Think about the data first, and the code will follow
  * Design projects specifically around use of various data structures
* Start with a [Java REPL](http://www.javarepl.com) instead of overwhelming students with a full project structure

## Week 1

* Data
  * Scalar (int, char, String)
  * Compound (Class, HashMap, Array, ArrayList)
    * Distinguish between key-value vs sequential data, static vs dynamic data
  * Create scalar and compound variables in a REPL
* Code
  * Class is not just a data structure; it can contain code (methods)
  * Create a blank project in the IDE
  * Create methods that initialize data the same way we did in the REPL
  * Discuss scope
  * Discuss static vs non-static, public vs private

## Week 2

* The main method
* Flow control
  * Conditionals
  * Loops

## Week 3

* Packages
* Imports
* Inheritance
  * @Overload
  * Casting
