## AngularSpring

Create a project via Spring Initializr called `AngularSpring` with the following libraries:

* Web
* DevTools
* JPA
* H2

Download [angular-spring.zip](https://github.com/oakes/java-assignments/raw/master/curriculum/assets/angular-spring.zip) and extract it into a folder called `public` in the root of the project. These assets are based on [this Angular + Spring tutorial](http://websystique.com/springmvc/spring-mvc-4-angularjs-example/).

Add the following to `application.properties`:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:./main
spring.jpa.generate-ddl=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
```

When you run it, you should see a UI in your browser and errors in the JavaScript console. We need to write the appropriate routes to make it work.

The tricky thing about Angular, and other JS frameworks, is that they send query parameters to the server as JSON. Thus far, we've always assumed they were encoded the "old school" way, URL encoding. To demonstrate this, here are two simplified examples of what each type of HTTP request looks like:

The traditional way using URL encoding:
```
POST /blog/posts
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

title=Hello%20World!&body=This%20is%20my%20first%20post!
```

The newer way using JSON encoding:
```
POST /blog/posts
Content-Type: application/json

{"title":"Hello World!","body":"This is my first post!‚Äù}
```

To correctly parse this on the server side, we need to stop receiving our query parameters the way we used to.
