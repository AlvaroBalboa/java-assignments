## Angular + Spring

Create a project via Spring Initializr called `AngularSpring` with the following libraries:

* Web
* DevTools
* JPA
* H2

Download [angular-spring.zip](https://github.com/oakes/java-assignments/raw/master/curriculum/assets/angular-spring.zip) and extract it into a folder called `public` in the root of the project. These assets are based on [this Angular + Spring project](http://websystique.com/springmvc/spring-mvc-4-angularjs-example/).

Add the following to `application.properties`:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:./main
spring.jpa.generate-ddl=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
```

When you run it, you should see a UI in your browser and errors in the JavaScript console. We need to write the appropriate routes to make it work.
