## Time

In the old days, the main way of tracking time in Java was `java.util.Date`. The fact that most of its methods are now deprecated is a stark indicator of its problems. While still in common use, the `Date` class has a number of puzzling design choices:

1. The year starts at 1900, so you'd give it the year 2000 with `d.setYear(100)`.
2. The month is a zero-indexed integer, so you'd give it the month of January with `d.setMonth(0)`.
3. The day, however, is not zero-indexed, so you'd give it the first day of the month with `d.setDate(1)`.
4. It's a mutable object (as indicated by the previous examples), so a date object can be unexpectedly changed by any method it is passed to.
5. It has no concept of timezones.

The `java.util.Calendar` class was later introduced to fix a few of the problems, but most of them remained. For a long time, the best advice was to ignore both classes and use the [Joda Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) library instead. In Java 8, it was added to the standard library under the `java.time` package.
