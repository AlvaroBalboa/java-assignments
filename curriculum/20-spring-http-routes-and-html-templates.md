## HelloSpring

Spring is a commonly used framework for building web services. We'll be using Spring Boot in particular, which is a version of Spring that allows you to generate a preconfigured project to get started quickly.

* Go to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)
* Choose "Gradle Project"
* Group is `com.theironyard` and artifact is `HelloSpring`
* Click "Switch to the full version"
* Check the following options:
  * Web
  * Mustache
  * DevTools
* Download and unzip the project
